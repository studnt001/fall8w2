    "For your analysis, you will need to:\n",
    "1) Inspect the wages.csv dataset (outside of your notebook) and provide a detailed description of the dataset.\n",
    "    - Include the variable's name, description and data type for each variable in the dataset.\n",
    "2) Create a fictitious business that fits the wages.csv dataset.\n",
    "3) Develop a problem statement and 5 analytical questions to be investigated during your analysis. \n",
    "    - For this exercise, you are limited to univariant analysis.\n",
    "    - At least 3 of your analytical questions should require Segmented Univariant Analysis.\n",
    "4) Utilize descriptive statistics to analyze each of your analytical questions.\n",
    "5) Recap of all your insights.\n",
    "6) Summarize your findings for our fictitious business.\n"
