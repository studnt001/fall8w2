NOTES

The Wave 82 survey is the U.S. component of Pew Research Center's 2021 Global Attitudes Project. 

For a small number of respondents with high risk of identification, certain values have been randomly swapped with those of lower risk cases with similar characteristics.

WEIGHTS 

The W82 dataset contains two weights:

WEIGHT_W82 is the weight for the sample. Data for most Pew Research Center reports are analyzed using this weight.
WEIGHT_W73_W82 is a longitudinal weight used in analysis for respondents to both W73 and W82. Publications using this weight are identified below.
